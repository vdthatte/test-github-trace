# iOS App: SwiftUI Button Example

This iOS app demonstrates the use of SwiftUI to create a simple user interface with a button. The app primarily displays a "Hello World" text and a button with a text label. When the button is tapped, it executes an action closure that prints "Button tapped" to the console.

This app was built using [Trace AI](https://trace.zip), and you can demo this particular project at [https://trace.zip/c/2b6f1ec0-2595-4259-a077-0f6061975c7a](https://trace.zip/c/2b6f1ec0-2595-4259-a077-0f6061975c7a).

## Building the App

To build the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS simulator or a physical device.

## App Structure

The app consists of a single `ContentView` struct that conforms to the `View` protocol. The `ContentView` has a `body` property that defines the layout and appearance of the user interface.

The `body` property contains a `VStack` that holds the following UI elements:

1. A `Text` element with the content "Hello World".
2. A `Button` with a `Text` label and an action closure.

The `Button` has an action closure that is executed when the button is tapped. The action closure simply prints "Button tapped" to the console.

## Preview

The app includes a `ContentView_Previews` struct that conforms to the `PreviewProvider` protocol. This allows you to preview the app's user interface in Xcode's canvas.
